### Sample OpenWrt config file ###

## General
# OpenWrt version. Set to 'snapshot' to build from latest snapshot
OPENWRT_SOURCE_VER=19.07.7
# Architecture: one of x86-64, armvirt-32 (Raspberry Pi 2 / 3 / 4),
# armvirt-64 (Raspberry Pi 3 / 4 running 64-bit OS, ODroid-C2 or similar),
# or bcm2708 (Raspberry Pi Zero)
ARCH=x86-64
# Image & tag for pre-built Docker image, or if building locally
IMAGE=oofnik/openwrt
TAG=latest
# container name
CONTAINER=openwrt_1

## Docker network settings
# Disable will not connect WAN interface to container.
# Usually be used when there is only one eth interface, 
# and the DHCP server and gateway already exist in the network. 
# It is recommended to set the LAN_GW when disable WAN
WAN_ENABLED=true
# name of the WAN Docker network
WAN_NAME=openwrt-wan
# Docker network driver for WAN interface. Use 'macvlan' for
# wired (Ethernet), 'ipvlan' for wireless (experimental).
WAN_DRIVER=macvlan
# Host interface which will provide the WAN link for OpenWrt.
WAN_PARENT=eth0
# upstream DNS for OpenWrt (optional, leave blank for default).
UPSTREAM_DNS_SERVER=8.8.8.8

# name of the LAN Docker network
LAN_NAME=openwrt-lan
# Docker network driver for LAN interface, can be one of
# 'bridge', 'macvlan', or 'ipvlan'.
# Don't change this unless you have good reason.
LAN_DRIVER=bridge
# For bridge driver, LAN_PARENT will be added to the LAN bridge.
# For macvlan or ipvlan driver, used as LAN parent interface.
# Can be a physical interface or a VLAN interface if
# operating with a single NIC (router on a stick).
# For example if WAN_PARENT is eth0, LAN_PARENT can be eth0.10 for
# VLAN 10. VLAN interface will be created if it doesn't exist, and
# destroyed on shutdown.
LAN_PARENT=eth0.10
# DNS search domain for LAN DHCP clients
LAN_DOMAIN=home
# Subnet configuration for LAN network
LAN_SUBNET=192.168.16.0/24
# Set LAN_ADDR to something other than the first available address
# in the subnet - Docker will claim this address for the host.
LAN_ADDR=192.168.16.2
# openwrt doesn't accept CIDR notation; must match LAN_SUBNET
LAN_NETMASK=255.255.255.0
# LAN gateway, empty when openwrt is the gateway
LAN_GW=

## Wifi settings
WIFI_ENABLED=true

# Only one of the following sections at a time (5 / 2.4 GHz) are supported!
## 5GHz 802.11ac (if your hw supports it)
# WIFI_HW_MODE=11a

# WIFI_CHANNEL=36
## 2.4 GHz 802.11g
WIFI_HW_MODE=11g
WIFI_HT_MODE=HT20
WIFI_CHANNEL=6
